#CATransition Demonstration

##Demonstrations
<img src="Demonstrations/fade.gif" width="24%"/>
<img src="Demonstrations/moveIn.gif" width="24%"/>
<img src="Demonstrations/push.gif" width="24%"/>
<img src="Demonstrations/reveal.gif" width="24%"/>

##Types (type of animation)
* fade
* moveIn
* push
* reveal

##Subtypes (direction of animation)
Not all types have a direction. As one can see from the above demonstrations, subtype directions make no changes to the transitions such as "fade."  
* fromLeft
* fromRight
* fromTop
* fromBottom

##How to use CATransition
You can either enter the types as constants, or use the String values that I have listed above.
